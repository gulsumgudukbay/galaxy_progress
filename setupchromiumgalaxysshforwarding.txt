TUTORIAL

Description: This tutorial is to forward ssh traffic to local browser. It is used to tackle the problem for slow 
execution of browsers when ssh -X forwarding is used when we are running galaxy in external nodes and when we want to 
access the UI. 

1. Creating a tunnel
ssh -vv -ND 9999 -i cloudlab.key user@ip
In which 9999 is the proxy port you created locally.

2. Make sure you are using SOCKS5 proxy option and 9999 when launching browser:

chromium --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:9999" -proxy-bypass-list='<-loopback>'

The --proxy-server="socks5://myproxy:9999" flag tells Chrome to send all http:// and https:// URL requests through the 
SOCKS proxy server "myproxy:9999", using version 5 of the SOCKS protocol. The hostname for these URLs will be resolved 
by the proxy server, and not locally by Chrome.

Loopback is to bypass localhost, so that we can redirect the traffic from galaxy 
to localhost
