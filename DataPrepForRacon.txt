Data Prep for Racon

Description: This tutorial is created to prepare the data for Racon. First, minimap2 and then miniasm is executed. 
Then, minimap is executed with the original reads mapped against the raw assembly, and then racon is executed. 

# Download sample PacBio from the PBcR website
wget -O- http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/PBcR/data/selfSampleData.tar.gz | tar zxf -

# Install minimap and miniasm (requiring gcc and zlib)

git clone https://github.com/lh3/minimap2 && (cd minimap2 && make)
git clone https://github.com/lh3/miniasm  && (cd miniasm  && make)

# Overlap for PacBio reads (or use "-x ava-ont" for nanopore read overlapping)

minimap2/minimap2 -x ava-pb -t8 selfSampleData/pacbio_filtered.fastq selfSampleData/pacbio_filtered.fastq | gzip -1 > reads.paf.gz

# Layout

miniasm/miniasm -f selfSampleData/pacbio_filtered.fastq reads.paf.gz > reads.gfa

# Convert to fasta

head -n 1 reads.gfa | awk '{print ">"$2; print $3}' > assembly.fasta

# We first use minimap again, this time with the original reads mapped against the ‘raw’ assembly:

minimap assembly.fasta selfSampleData/pacbio_filtered.fastq > reads_mapped.paf

# Then use racon

racon -t 2 selfSampleData/pacbio_filtered.fastq reads_mapped.paf assembly.fasta output_name.fasta
